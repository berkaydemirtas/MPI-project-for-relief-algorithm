# MPI-project-for-relief-algorithm
In this project, we are asked to apply relief alghorithm in parallel manner to given data set with Mpi interface. There is 1 master processor and (P-1) slave processors. (P is the total number processors). Master procesor handles I/O operations and send the given data to slave processor (same number of instance to each of them, number of iterations and number of feature need to be detected by each slave ). Slave processors applies relief alghorithm. Relief is an algorithm that enables us to detect most important and varying features in our data set.
